# zenrates
Cinnamon desklet for showing currency exchange rates in real-time from stock exchange (zenrus.ru)
## Installation
1. Copy or clone this folder to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets
2. Right click on Cinnamon desktop - Add Desklets
3. Select 'Currency rates' desklet and click plus (+) icon at the bottom
4. Configure if needed
## Important notes
There are chances that you'll receive nothing after installing desklet. Also, after log in into Cinnamon, you could see blank screen (black colored with mouse cursor) due to unknown reasons. This is mostly came from Cinnamon internals and how they work with GJS (GNOME Javascript). I cannot normally debug this things due to the lack of tools, unfortunately.
